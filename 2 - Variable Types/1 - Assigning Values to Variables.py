#Variables do not need explicit declaration to resever memory space.
#The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a..
#..variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

#The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable..
#..and the operand to teh right of the = operator is the value stored..
#..in the variable.
counter = 100 #An integer assignment
miles = 1000.0 #A floating point
name = "John" #A string

print(counter)
print(miles)
print(name)
