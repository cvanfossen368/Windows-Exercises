#The line below will display the prompt and,
#the satement saying "Press the enter key to exit",
#and then waits for the user to take action.
input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit")
#"\n\n" is used here to create two lines before displaying the..
#..actual line. Once the user presses the key, the program ends..
#..This is a nice trick to keep a console window open until the user..
#..is done with the application.
